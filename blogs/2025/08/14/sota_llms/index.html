Later on <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">transformers</a> is proposed based on the idea of attention. This paper proposed the transformer architecture for the machine translation problem. As RNN heavily relies on the previous state, the inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples. Those authors proposed to only use attention mechanisms to draw global dependencies between input and output. <strong>This method allows for more parallelization and enable the possibility for scaling.</strong> For previous translation models, they are all encoder-decoder models, each of those step those models are all <em>auto-regressive</em>, which means they consumed the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next. Transformer follows this overall architecture.</p> <p>In this paper, they have one multi-head self-attention layer (I’ll call it as attention layer in the following for simplicity) in each encoder block, one masked attention layer and one attention layer in the decoder block. The masking here is to ensure the predictions for position $i$ can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than $i$.</p> <h3 id="scaled-dot-product-self-attention">Scaled Dot-product Self-Attention</h3> <blockquote> <p>The attention section is extended to more variance in another note fofr attention! Here we only have basic introduction for the later understanding of the model archtechture.</p> </blockquote> <p>We don’t go to the details of attention computation, but here are some great resources to understand <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-06-24-attention/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">attentions</a>. At a high-level, attention is used to compute a representation to the pair of input at position $i$ and output at position $t$, $(y_t, x_i)$, based on how well they match. There are a lot of attentions people proposed before, in the Transformer paper, they proposed the scaled dot-product attention. ( \text{Attention}(Q,K,V) = softmax(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}})V <br> ) It’s very related to the dot-product attention but adding a scaling factor to scaling the attention numbers based on the dimension of the source vector and make sure the dot product values remain in a more reasonable range, preventing extremely large or small softmax outputs.</p> <p>Multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions.</p> <p><em>Here is a very brief proof about why we got $\sqrt{d_k}$ as the scaling factor:</em></p> <p>What’s the problem if we don’t do scaling? – the variance of $QK^T$ is large for a big $d_k$.</p> <p>Assume $Q, K$ are two random vectors, $Q={q_1, …, q_{d_k}}$, $K={k_1, …, k_{d_k}}$, $q_i, k_i \sim N(0,1)$ and independent.</p> <p>( Var(QK^T) = Var(\sum_i^{d_k}q_ik_i) = \sum_i^{d_k} Var(q_ik_i) <br> Var(q_ik_i) = E[(q_ik_i)^2]-[E(q_ik_i)]^2 = E(q_i)^2E(k_i)^2 = 1 <br> Var(QK^T) = d_k )</p> <h4 id="whats-the-differences-between-q-k-and-v">What’s the differences between $Q$, $K$ and $V$?</h4> <p>Or ask this question: With this Q and K vectors we calculate attention and multiply it with V .</p> <p>From the computation perspective, they are different linear projections of the same input sequence, though each serving a different role by our interpretation.</p> <p><strong><span style="color:red">TODO Papers</span></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.09419" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Compositional Attention: Disentangling Search and Retrieval, ICLR 2022</a></li> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.10203" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Exploring the Space of Key-Value-Query Models with Intention</a></li> </ul> <h4 id="why-self-attention">Why self-attention?</h4> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Layer Type</th> <th>Complexity per Layer</th> <th>Sequential Operations</th> <th>Maximum Path Length</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Self-Attention</td> <td>(O(n^2 \cdot d))</td> <td>(O(1))</td> <td>(O(1))</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Recurrent</td> <td>(O(n \cdot d^2))</td> <td>(O(n))</td> <td>(O(n))</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Convolutional</td> <td>(O(k \cdot n \cdot d^2))</td> <td>(O(1))</td> <td>(O(\log_k(n)))</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Self-Attention (restricted)</td> <td>(O(r \cdot n \cdot d))</td> <td>(O(1))</td> <td>(O(n/r))</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <ol> <li> <p>Computation complexity per layer, parallel computing to improve the training efficiency. length $n$ is smaller than the representation dimensionality $d$ – <strong>this is not ture in the LLM years for long-context</strong></p> </li> <li>Learning long-range dependencies</li> <li>Better interpretability</li> </ol> <p><em>Related resources for attention machenism:</em></p> <ul> <li> <a href="https://supaiku.com/attention-is-logarithmic" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Blog: Attention is logarithmic, actually</a>: really interesting and helpful blog give an insight of how parallel computation today influence the computation complexity we need to consider.</li> </ul> <h3 id="positional-encoding">Positional Encoding</h3> <p>The shortcoming of the scaled dot attention is that it doesn’t account for positions - two vectors will have the same dot product, regardless of how close they are to each other in the input sequence. The position encoding is a way to modify each vector in a way that incorporates informationi about its position.</p> <p>In the original transformers, the positional encoding is happened after the embedding layer to inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence. Because the transformer processes input tokens in parallel, so it does not automatically know their positions.</p> <p>(Nice insight from the RoPE paper!) The intuition for adding position encoding through production is because if we compute the dot products of two vectors, it measures the closeness of the two vectors. To get the related position information, for two tokens at position (m) and position (n), we need a function to express the information of (n-m). For a token at position $m$, denoted as $x_m$ and a token at position $n$, $x_n$, in the computation of attention: ( a_{m,n} = \text{sfotmax}(q_mk_n^T)=\frac{exp(\frac{q_m^T k_n}{\sqrt{d_k}})}{\sum_{j=1}^N exp(\frac{q_m^T k_n}{\sqrt{d_k}})} <br> o_{m,n} = \sum_{n=1}^N a_{m,n} v_n )</p> <p>In the computation of attention, the information about the two vector’s positioin is contained in the dot production of $q_m$ and $k_n$. So, the position encoding function $f$, which is the function for the $q$ and $k$ vector should be able to transform to a function about the relative position $m-n$. Formally defined as:</p> <p>( \langle f_q(x_m, m), f_k(x_m,n)\rangle = g(x_m, x_n, m-n) )</p> <p>So, for the sinusoidal positional encoding.</p> <p>( PE(pos, 2i) = sin(pos/\theta^{2i/d_{model}}) <br> PE(pos, 2i+1) = cos(pos/\theta^{2i/d_{model}}) )</p> <p>$pos$ is the token’s position in the sequence, $i$ is the dimension index, $d_{model}$ is the model’s embedding size, (\theta) is setted to a big number to avoid the model getting same positional representations of different potions in a large distance. This function can make sure (1) each dimension follows a sinusoidal curve, ensuring unique encodings; (2) allows extrapolation to longer sequences, unlike learned embeddings, which are fixed to training sequence lengths, this function can generalize to unseen lengths.</p> <p>Rotary position encoding (RoPE), which is still the best popular positional encoding technique. The previous sinusoidal function is a pre-defined function, and other learned and relative position encoding methods are all adding the position information to the context representation and thus render them unsuitable for the <em>linear self-attention</em> architecture (check the note for <a href="">attention</a>).</p> <blockquote> <p>A brief introduction about the linear self-attention: The self attention can be rewritten in this way: ( Attention(Q,K,V)<em>m = \frac{\sum</em>{n=1}^N sim(q_m,k_n)v_n}{\sum_{n=1}^N sim(q_m,k_n)} = \frac{\sum_{n=1}^N exp(q_m^Tk_n/\sqrt{d_k})v_n}{\sum_{n=1}^N exp(q_m^Tk_n/\sqrt{d_k})} ) so, in the original self-attention we should compute the inner product of query and key for every pair of tokens, which has a quadratic complexity. But a linear attentions (<a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/katharopoulos20a.html?ref=mackenziemorehead.com" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">paper</a>) reformulate as: ( Attention(Q,K,V)<em>m = \frac{\sum</em>{n=1}^N \phi(q_m)^T \psi(k_n) v_n}{\sum_{n=1}^N \phi(q_m)^T \psi(k_n)} ), where $\phi()$ and $\psi()$ are non-negative functions and first compute the multiplication between keys and values using the associative property of matrix multiplication.</p> </blockquote> <p>The previous position encoding can not suitable for the linear self-attention in modern transformers. To solve this problem, RoPE proposed to encode the absolute position with a rotation matrix and meanwhile incorporates the explicit relative position dependency in self-attention formulation.</p> <p>With the RoPE in linear self-attention, the norm of the hidden representation keep unchanged because the position information is injected by rotation matrix:</p> <p>( Attention(Q,K,V)<em>m = \frac{\sum</em>{n-1}^N (R_{\Phi,m}\Theta^d \phi(q_m))^T(R_{\Phi,n}\psi(k_n))v_n}{\sum_{n=1}^{N} \phi(q_m)^T\psi(k_n)} <br> )</p> <p>In the rotary position embedding, the authors found a solution for vectors on a 2D plane by its complex form:</p> <p>( f_q(x_m, m) = (W_q x_m) e^{im\theta}<br> f_k(x_n, n) = (W_k, x_n) e^{in\theta}<br> \langle f_q(x_m, m), f_k(x_m,n)\rangle = g(x_m, x_n, m-n) = Re[(W_qx_m)(W_kx_n)e^i{m-n}\theta] )</p> <p>in this function, $e^{i m \theta}$ is equal to a rotary matrix, for a more general setting, we can have the rotary matrix for dimension $d_k$.</p> <p>There are also some newer positional encoding methods, there would be more details in the following sections.
