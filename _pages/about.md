I am a second-year PhD student at <a href="https://www.cis.mpg.de/">CS@Max Planck</a> and <a href="https://www.mpi-sws.org/">Max Planck Institute for Software System (MPI-SWS)</a>, under the guidance of <a href="https://people.mpi-sws.org/~gummadi/">Krishna Gummadi</a>. My research focuses on understanding the inner workings of deep learning systems and establishing trustworthy AI systems. Currently, I am investigating methods for estimating, injecting, and retrieving latent knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs).

Prior to joining MPI-SWS, I earned my bachelor's degree in mathematics-physics from the Yingcai Honors College at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC).
