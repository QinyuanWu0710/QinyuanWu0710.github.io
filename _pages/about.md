I am a third-year PhD student at <a href="https://www.cis.mpg.de/">CS@Max Planck</a> and <a href="https://www.mpi-sws.org/">Max Planck Institute for Software System (MPI-SWS)</a>, under the guidance of <a href="https://people.mpi-sws.org/~gummadi/">Krishna Gummadi</a>. I am also fortunate to closely collaborate with and be advised by  <a href="https://cs-people.bu.edu/evimaria/">Evimaria Terzi</a>, <a href="https://mtoneva.com/">Mariya Toneva</a> and <a href="https://informatik.rub.de/zafar/">Muhammad Bilal Zafar</a>. 
  My research interests lie in exploring the internal mechanics of deep learning models, as a foundation for building more reliable AI systems, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) recently. I focus on understanding how these models encode, recall, and process information, including the dynamics of memorization and the challenges in estimating latent knowledge. By gaining deeper insights into these mechanisms, my work aims to support the development of more dependable and transparent deep learning systems.

<!-- Prior to joining MPI-SWS, I earned my bachelor's degree in mathematics-physics fundamental science from the <a href="https://www.yingcai.uestc.edu.cn//">Yingcai Honors College</a> at the <a href="https://en.uestc.edu.cn/">University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)</a>. -->
